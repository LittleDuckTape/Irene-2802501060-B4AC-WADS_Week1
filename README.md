## Article: Web App Security
The methods and strategies used to defend web applications from online attacks are referred to as **web application security**. Because web apps can be accessed through the internet, hackers often target them to steal information or interfere with services.

One common security risk is **SQL Injection**. An attacker can insert malicious SQL code into a login form or other input field. This allows the attacker unauthorized access to the database if the program fails to appropriately check user input. To avoid this, use input validation and prepared statements.

**Cross-Site Scripting(XSS)** is another common risk. This occurs when a hacker inserts malicious code into a webpage that other users are seeing. Thus, cookies and user session information may be stolen by these scripts. To lower this risk, developers should correctly encode output and sanitize user input.

Developers should follow practices like frequent security testing, software updates, and using security tools (e.g., firewalls) to increase the security of web applications. There are services dedicated to protect web apps like Cloudflare. Cloudflare helps prevent common attacks and filter unwanted traffic.

In conclusion, all developers must understand how web application security is important and why. Proper security is done by identifying common threats and applying proper security measures.
